    testing framework

        why not use jest

            mock everything
            very easy to etst every piece of code

        jest test automatically does coverage

    webpack
        code split

    webpack finally packages everying into one js file
        say your app has 10 pages
            when you load the first page you loading all 10 pages

    jest

    codesplit

    now building the app
    10 mb after packaging it
    too much
    still adding
